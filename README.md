# Geckos PECS (PICTURE EXCHANGE COMMUNICATION SYMBOLS) APP

## Intro

We have set out to build an app which helps users with impaired verbal communication or limited understanding to communicate with pictures. Playing to our collective strengths we are going for a React front end, and creating a PHP based API with a MYSQL database.

We are aiming for simplicity, and an easy to user interface.

## MVP

A user can view a series of images, highlight an image and create a 'storyboard' of images

A user can add new images to their view from a supplied gallery, or from their own personal files.

A user can organize images based on self defined categories.
