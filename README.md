  PECS APP | Chingu Voyage-6 | https://chingu.io/
  
  This web app is targeted at users with impaired verbal communication. I built it during a chingu voyage as a build to learn project. I chose PECS (picture exchange communication system) for my project because I used to work with people with autism, I had one particular client in mind who would really benefit from a very simple app of this style.
  
  Uses -> React, Redux, Express, Node, Mongo, Mongoose, JSON Web Tokens for auth.
